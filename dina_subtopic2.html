  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article describes how using AI as a guided learning tool can aid students in developing critical thinking skills. AI systems offer engaging tasks, feedback, and simple reasoning that encourage greater understanding. AI encourages students to compare and critically assess concepts by providing a variety of perspectives and solutions. AI helps students examine, reflect, and make accurate choices by scaffolding the cognitive process rather than taking the place of thinking.</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The article highlights artificially intelligent resources that use interactive problem-solving, simulations, and metacognitive indicators to enhance critical thinking in the classroom. Students can test hypotheses, analyze outcomes, and reflect on reasoning processes. These AI programs offer individual support that fosters the growth of students' abilities in independent thought, analytical reasoning, and evidence evaluation. When applied correctly, AI enhances critical thinking rather than weakening it.</p>
