  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This essay addresses worries that using AI in the classroom will lessen students' capacity for independent thought by offering quick fixes. It highlights how pupils lack the cognitive battle necessary to comprehend and analyze material when they rely too much on AI-generated summaries or issue solutions. Teachers worry that relying too much on AI could impair intellectual resilience, decrease engagement with the courses, and damage critical thinking abilities.</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The paper emphasizes how AI can unintentionally limit critical thinking by speeding up learning at the cost of thinking. Instead of interacting with difficult ideas on their own, students can grow dependent on AI for solutions. It also tackles the danger of false information being introduced by AI-generated content, which could deceive students who take it in its entirety. The essay emphasizes how crucial independent thought and active engagement are to learning.</p>
